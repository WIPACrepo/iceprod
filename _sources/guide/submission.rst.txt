Dataset Submission
==================

Submission Types
----------------

There are three types of submission: basic, advanced, and expert.

Basic View
^^^^^^^^^^

The basic view is designed for the case of "I want to run this script."

It requires a URL (http or gridftp) to the script. All other boxes are
optional, though filling in the description is highly recommended.

Then enter the number of jobs and hit submit.

Advanced View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The advanced view is for running multiple tasks and more complex scenarios.
It is currently a direct translation from the json config to html structure.

This is under revision to make it easier to use.  Comments welcome.

Expert View
^^^^^^^^^^^

The expert view shows the raw json configuration. Copying/pasting
the configuration is very easy here.

.. warning:: Be careful of json syntax errors!

Macros
------

IceProd has several built-in macros relating to what task is actually running.

`$(dataset_id)`
    The dataset_id string.

`$(dataset)`
    The dataset_id in numerical form.

    .. note:: Numbering starts at 20000 for IceProd 2 datasets.

`$(jobs_submitted)`
    The number of jobs in the dataset.

`$(job)`
    The job index within the dataset. Within the range `[0, jobs_submitted)`.

`$(task_id)`
