* idle: tasks in global queue
* waiting: tasks in local queue
* queued: tasks queued to a batch system
* processing: tasks are running
* suspended: if ``debug = True`` `suspend` instead of `reset` or `fail`
* reset: shallow reset

  * by default goes back to `waiting`
  * if reset >= 3, back to `idle`

* resume: hard reset
