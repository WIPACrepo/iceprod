Asynchronous Programming
========================

Some Background
---------------

There has been a large movement in the python community for asynchronous
programming. Examples include Twisted, Tornado, ZeroMQ, pyftpdlib, 
libevent, libev, pyev, libuv, wattle, etc. More officially, it has been
accepted into the python standard library as ``asyncio`` as of python 3.4.

Brief Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asynchronous programming refers to two related concepts:

* I/O bound scalability, opening multiple socket connections with a 
  single thread.
  
  This is relevant to the `C10k problem <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem>`_,
  as a single thread can handle many connections if it does not
  wait for remote I/O operations to finish before moving to the next
  connection.

* Explicit cooperative multi-threading, where yield points are visible
  and known.

  One relevant quote from Nick Coghlan:

    When writing implicitly asynchronous code, you have to assume that you
    may lose control of the execution at any point, since even something as
    innocuous as retrieving an attribute from an object may suspend the thread
    of control. By contrast, with explicitly asynchronous code, it is safe to
    assume that you have sole access to shared data structures between
    suspension points.
  
  Thus the focus on explicit yield points, which grants "locks" on data without
  worrying about the complexities of thread safety.

For IceProd, the first concept is the most important one.  Scalability is one
of the primary goals, so making sure servers can handle thousands of requests 
per second is important. The rest of this documentation will focus on that.

Whatever the method of getting asynchronous, the goal is to allow the main 
thread to continue processing additional requests while the current request is
processed (or waiting) somewhere else. While this doesn't work well for
compute-bound applications, network I/O lends itself very well to this because
of the high latencies between network events.  Thus, as long as the main 
thread can check for a new request every few microseconds, it can also run a 
large number of shorter functions at the same time.

In practice, the main benefit comes when interacting with a filesystem or 
database. Both of these actions would normally spend a large number of clock 
cycles waiting for a return value, but can now do useful work in the meantime.

Practical Usage
---------------

Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^

The traditional method of going asynchronous is by `callback functions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O#Callback_functions>`_.
Instead of waiting for a long function to return, it is instead given a 
callback and returns immediately. Eventually the original action will be 
finished and call the callback.

Tornado
'''''''

IceProd's main access to asynchronous I/O is through `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org>`_.
This is the basic framework for the website, and provides utility functions 
for asynchronous sockets that are used in several other places.  Tornado 
also allows us to make http downloads asynchronously.

A basic Hello World example is::

    from functools import partial
    from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
    
    def hello_world(loop):
        print('Hello World')
        loop.stop()
    
    loop = IOLoop.instance()
    
    # Schedule a call to hello_world()
    loop.add_callback(partial(hello_world,loop))
    
    # Blocking call interrupted by loop.stop()
    loop.start()
    loop.close()

GridFTP
'''''''

Using the C API for the `Globus Toolkit <http://www.globus.org/toolkit>`_ 
allows us to use GridFTP asynchronously as well.  This has been integrated 
into Tornado's callback mechanism in Python with mostly complete pybindings 
for ease of use.

Callback Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functions that accept callbacks generally take the form of::

    def foo(arg1,arg2,callback):
        # do some work
        callback(result)

The callback argument should be a function capable of handling the result it 
is given.

For I/O applications, it is often necessary to pass connection details to the 
callback function.  There are two approaches:

1. Quick and Dirty:

    .. code-block:: python

        def foo(arg1,callback,callback_args):
            # do work
            callback(result,callback_args)
        def cb(result,args):
            # handle result
        foo(1,cb,{'handle':None})

|
|     This passes callback arguments through the worker function using a second argument.  It is used often in lower level languages where things must be compiled to binary before running.

2. Functional Programming:

    .. code-block:: python

        def foo(arg1,callback):
            # do work
            callback(result)
        def cb(result,args={}):
            # handle result
        foo(1,partial(cb,args={'handle':None}))

|
|     In functional programming, function signatures can be changed by filling in only some of the arguments and treating that as a new function.  Python allows this with the ``functools.partial()`` built-in.

Much of the code in the IceProd server uses the functional programming 
style, though there is some of the first style in the GridFTP python bindings.

Futures
-------

Starting in python 3.2, and available as a backport with the ``futures`` 
package, asynchronous actions have more official support::

    # Run slow operations in parallel using threads.
    # Instead of taking 5 seconds, this should only take 1 second.

    import time
    import concurrent.futures

    def slow_operation():
        time.sleep(1)

    # make a futures executor that launches 5 worker threads
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # queue the operations
        queue_operations = [executor.submit(slow_operation) for _ in range(5)]
        for future in queue_operations:
            try:
                # wait for this one to finish
                future.result()
            except Exception:
                pass

IceProd already has Tornado to do the heavy lifting that the
``ThreadPoolExecutor`` would do.  And in fact, it gets even easier.

In the Tornado request handler, where the get or post method is usually
defined, ``tornado.gen.coroutine`` and ``tornado.concurrent.run_on_executor``
can be used to provide a yield-like syntax for callback functions::

    # Using Tornado, run slow operations in parallel using threads.
    # Instead of taking 5 seconds, this should only take 1 second.
    import time
    import concurrent.futures
    import tornado.web
    import tornado.ioloop
    import tornado.concurrent

    class slow_op:
        def __init__(self):
            self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
            self.io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance()

        # wrap this function such that it returns a Future
        @tornado.concurrent.run_on_executor
        def slow_operation(self):
            time.sleep(1)
            return True

    class MyHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
        # get the global slop_op instance
        def initialize(self,ops):
            self.ops = ops

        # handle Futures inline with yield
        @tornado.gen.coroutine
        def get(self):
            ret = yield self.ops.slow_operation()
            self.write(str(ret))


    # make a futures executor that launches 5 worker threads
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:

        # launch tornado
        app = tornado.web.Application([
            (r"/.*", MyHandler, {'ops':slow_op()}),
        ])
        app.listen(8888)
        tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()

Test this with:

.. code-block:: bash

    time (curl http://localhost:8888 & curl http://localhost:8888 & curl http://localhost:8888 & curl http://localhost:8888 & curl http://localhost:8888 & wait)

Or, if you already have an asynchronous function with a callback, you can use
``tornado.concurrent.return_future`` to make it return a Future. Note that
the function should be truly asynchronous, with no blocking before the 
function returns. Good examples of this are network calls where you expect
the result to be returned in the callback whenever it happens.

AsyncIO
-------

Starting in python 3.4 an asynchronous I/O library has been included in
python. This takes the place of ``tornado`` in some of the previous examples.
A basic Hello World example is::

    import asyncio
    
    def hello_world(loop):
        print('Hello World')
        loop.stop()
    
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    
    # Schedule a call to hello_world()
    loop.call_soon(hello_world, loop)
    
    # Blocking call interrupted by loop.stop()
    loop.run_forever()
    loop.close()
