src			Source path of class. If value is not a valid url, it is first prefixed by parameters.resource_url which defaults to “http://x2100.icecube.wisc.edu/downloads/”. If this is not value the system then tries prefixing it with parameters.svn_repository which defaults to “http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/svn/projects/”
