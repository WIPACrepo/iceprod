IceProd

IceProd is a Python framework for distributed management of batch jobs.  It runs as a layer on top of other batch middleware such as CREAM, Condor, and PBS and can pool together resources from different batch systems.  The primary purpose is to coordinate and administer many large sets of jobs at once, keeping a history of the entire job lifecycle.

Install Homebrew to the directory of your choice:
    git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew
    echo "export PATH=~/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.linuxbrew/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    export PATH=~/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.linuxbrew/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
